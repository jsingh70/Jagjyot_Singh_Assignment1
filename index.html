<p> 
My name is Jagjyot Singh. I was born in India, and moved to Arizona when I was 7 years old. <br>
I currently am attending Arizona State University, pursing my degree in Informatics. <br>
I've lived in the same house as the one I moved into, and live there with my mom and dad.  <br>
I enjoy playing sports with my friends, and also enjoy partying with them. <br>
